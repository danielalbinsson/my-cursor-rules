# Project Structure

## Main Structure
- Main app is in `apps/web`
- Packages are in the `packages` folder
- Server actions are in `apps/web/utils/actions` folder

## File Naming and Organization
- Use kebab case for route directories (e.g., `api/hello-world/route`)
- Use PascalCase for components (e.g. `components/Button.tsx`)
- Shadcn components are in `components/ui`
- All other components are in `components/`
- Colocate files in the folder where they're used unless they can be used across the app
- If a component can be used in many places, place it in the `components` folder

## New Pages
- Create new pages at: `apps/web/app/(app)/PAGE_NAME/page.tsx`
- Components for the page are either in `page.tsx` or in the `apps/web/app/(app)/PAGE_NAME` folder
- Pages are Server components for direct data loading
- Components with `onClick` must be client components with `use client` directive
- Server action files must start with `use server`

## Utility Functions
- Create utility functions in `utils/` folder for reusable logic
